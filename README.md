# VC Starter Theme
Starter Theme represents the VC  Team's opinionated starting point for new projects. It strives to include up-to-date best practices and solutions that we have deemed needed for the majority of projects we build. It is a reflection of whatâ€™s possible when building a theme! 
The Starter Theme is not a framework but rather a starting point for your theme in VC project!

## The main project goals:
- Demonstration of all current and future functionality that can be presented in the VC platform and storefront
- Plays opinionated starting point  for all new projects constructed on VC storefront. And due to its simplicity and well-knownness, it also provides of a special knowledge base and example.
- Have a initial styles constructed by using popular CSS methodology and technologies such as BEM, Sass  and have a adaptive markup allows working on all popular devices and resolutions
- Intentional lack of using 3rd party CSS and JS libraries and components.
- Provides a specific file structure for templates rendered on the server side (we can left the Shopify structure)
- Provides a collection of handy utility JS libraries and components which assist theme developers with problems unique to VC themes development environment.Theme scripts components are uncoupled from a particular UI.  Typically, they are used alongside a customized solution for a particular theme and aren't  enforce a particular pattern to display or update the visual state.
